# Haiti-Earthquake-Images
Images collected over Haiti following the 2010 earthquake.  One important goal with these images was locating blue tarps that are indicators of displaced people and makeshift villages.  Automated identification of the blue tarps was used to locate displaced people and distribute food, water, and other resources following the 2010 earthquake.
